# Dropbox in Docker

This repository provides the [adamkdean/dropbox](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/adamkdean/dropbox/) image.

This was previously `janeczku/dropbox` but that repo has become stale.

See original repo for more docs.

*NO LONGER MAINTAINED: Effective 9/1/2024, Dropbox required Linux to run on 64-bit OS, at which point we shifted to other solutions. https://help.dropbox.com/installs/system-requirements#linux*
